Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to create a binary classifier deep learning model using TensorFlow. The model is designed to predict whether organizations funded by Alphabet Soup will successfully use the funding, based on historical data of funded organizations. The goal is to optimize the use of funding by predicting and selecting organizations that are likely to succeed.

Results

Data Preprocessing
Target Variable(s):
IS_SUCCESSFUL: This variable indicates whether the funding was used effectively by the organization, serving as the target for the model.
Feature Variables:
All other columns in the dataset except EIN and NAME were used as features, including organization type, income amount, application type, and several others after encoding categorical variables into numerical format.
Variables Removed:
EIN (Employer Identification Number) and NAME: These columns were removed as they are identifiers and do not contribute predictive power to the model.
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
Neurons, Layers, and Activation Functions:
The model included three layers:
First hidden layer: 100 neurons, relu activation function.
Second hidden layer: 50 neurons, relu activation function.
Output layer: 1 neuron, sigmoid activation function.
These choices were made to provide enough capacity to learn from the complex dataset, with relu helping to avoid vanishing gradients and sigmoid used for binary classification.
Target Model Performance:
The initial goal was to achieve higher than 75% accuracy. The model reached an accuracy of approximately 72% (insert your result here).
Steps to Increase Model Performance:
Adjusted the number of neurons and layers: Tested different configurations to find the best setup for our data.
Experimented with advanced techniques: Implemented dropout and regularization to reduce overfitting.
Optimized epochs and batch sizes: Tuned these parameters to find the best balance between training time and model performance.

Summary

The neural network model developed in this analysis showed promising results, but there is room for improvement to consistently achieve the target performance of over 75% accuracy. The complexity of the dataset and the variability in organization success criteria pose significant challenges.

Recommendations for Alternative Models
Gradient Boosting Classifiers: These could be effective as they combine multiple weak learning hypotheses to create a strong predictive model. They are often more interpretable and can handle a variety of data types and interactions well.
Random Forest: As an ensemble method, it can provide a more robust prediction by averaging multiple decision trees which individually consider random subsets of features and samples, reducing the variance and risk of overfitting.
Both alternatives should be tested and compared to the neural network to determine the most effective approach for this specific classification task.
